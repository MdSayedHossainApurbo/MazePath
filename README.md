# MazePath
Maze Path Finding using Backtracking explores paths in a grid-based maze using recursion. The algorithm tries possible moves, backtracks on dead ends, and finds a valid path from start to destination. Great for learning recursion, backtracking, and applications in puzzles, AI, and robotics.
